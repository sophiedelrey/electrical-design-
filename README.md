# Project Overview
This semester project involved creating both a Mechanical Drawing and an Electrical Drawing for a standard apartment.

For the Mechanical Drawing, the task included drafting the front, plan, and side views, along with a cross-sectional view taken from a suitable vertical plane in either the front or side elevation.

The Electrical Drawing component required designing the low-voltage electrical system for a multi-room apartment while adhering to relevant regulations and standards. This included calculating voltage drop, selecting appropriate cable types, and determining conduit diameters. The electrical supply was assumed to be a three-phase system operating at 230/400V, 50Hz, with TN grounding.
